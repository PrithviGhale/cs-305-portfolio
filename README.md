CS 305 Module Eight Journal

Client and Software Requirements

For this project that I did in this class, the client was Artemis Financial, and this is a financial services company that works with many different types of sensitive customer information. What the company wanted to make sure of was to make sure that its software was all secure and that it protected the users' data during communication. The main goal for this was to find any security weaknesses in the application and to suggest different ways to fix them. Artemis Financial needed better protection, such as secure communication, encryption, and also safer coding practices.

What I Did Well and Why Secure Coding Matters

I think that I did a pretty good job identifying security risks that were there in the software by carefully reviewing the code and its dependencies. It is very important to note that finding these kinds of issues early is crucial because secure coding helps a lot to prevent any data breaches or leaks and keeps the user information safe and secure. Software security is important for a company because it helps build a good trust with the customers, reduces risk, and it also helps the company to avoid any serious security problems.

Challenges and Helpful Parts of the Project

I had a lot of challenges during this project, but one of them was to understand the different types of vulnerabilities and, at the same time, how serious they could be. But, even though it was challenging, it was very helpful for me because it taught me how to look at software from a security point of view, which is something I never thought of doing. The vulnerability assessment process helped me better understand how attackers might take advantage of any weak areas in the code.

How I Improved Security

The way I improved the security was by identifying specific weaknesses in the application, and I explained how to fix them. I also recommended enforcing HTTPS and TLS so that the data is encrypted during communication. Another thing I suggested was updating the outdated libraries like Spring, Log4j, and Jackson that had known security vulnerabilities. I also recommended adding input validation, authentication, security headers, and better error handling. This is because using multiple layers of security helps a lot when it comes to protecting the application, even if one layer fails.

Making Sure the Software Was Secure and Worked Correctly

After I was done looking through the vulnerabilities, what I did first was make sure that the recommended security fixes would not break the application's basic functionality. I also checked the dependency reports again and again to confirm that updating the libraries removed the known vulnerabilities and that it did not introduce any new ones. Reviewing the code after the dependency scan results really helped me a lot to make sure that the application remained secure and stable after the changes I made.

Tools and Practices I Will Use Again

For the tools I used, I used the Maven Dependency Check plugin to find any known vulnerabilities there are and CVEs in third-party libraries. I also followed secure coding practices like input validation, encryption, and proper configuration management. All of these tools and practices really helped me a lot understand how to identify risks early on and will be useful in future software development projects.

What I Would Show Future Employers

For future employers, I would show them this vulnerability assessment report to show my ability to analyze any software security risks there are and also the recommended solution for them. In this project, it shows that I understand how to identify vulnerabilities, use security tools, and how to apply secure coding practices to protect sensitive financial data.
